XEEChatInputView documentation
========

XEEChatInputView is a simple and intuitive control for inputing text and photo content inside a chat-like environment.
One example for usage of such control is if you want to implement a messenger like the one on Facebook or Snapchat. When text grows in volume and breaks in multiple lines, the entire containing view grows with it until it reaches a pre-defined maximum size. At that point textView becomes scrollable and you can continue to write as much as you want.

Photo button enables you to take a photo or pick one from photo library and send it just as a text message.
Submit button notifies a delegate and passes all the information that a message comprises.
